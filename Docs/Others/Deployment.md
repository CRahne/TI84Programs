## Connecting to Your Computer

Materials: 

- Computer with a USB-A port
- TI-Connect CE 
(found [here](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw))
- USB A to USB Mini B (came with calculator)
- TI 84 Calculator (Plus, Plus CE)

Plug the Micro USB end of the cable in on your calculator, and then take the USB A end and plug it into your computer. In the TI-Connect CE, it should be able to find your calculator easily.


## Getting the Program

Dowload the .zip project and unzip the files into a preferred location. Then, with TI Connect and the calculator connected, go to the Connected Calculator Workspace and press the button with the arrow going away from the computer (farthest right). When the dialog box opens, pick the program from your files and click ok to download. Done!
