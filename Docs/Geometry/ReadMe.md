# Geometry

Good collection of geometry (2D) equations. These are seperated into three categories: area, surface area, and volume. That's how it is seperated in this documentation

### Area

| Name    | Desc                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Circle](AREACIRC.md)  | Standard area of a circle from a radius                          |
| [Rectangle](ZSCORE.md)          | Standard area of a rectanble from its width and height           |
| [Sqaure]()  | Area of a sqaure found by sqauring one length of the shape                           |
| [Triangle]()  | Area of a triange with it being 1/2 of the the product of the length and height    |
