```
:Disp "AREA OF A TRIANGLE"
:Input "HEIGHT ",H
:Input "WIDTH ",W
:Disp (W*H*(1/2))
```

#### Program Desc

This program will ask for the width and height, and then return the area in units sqaured

#### Equation

area = 0.5 *x* h *x* w. The triangle is just a halfed parrallelogram, and that is why the equation is simply that halved. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle)
