# Standard Error of the Mean
```
:Disp "STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEAN"
:Input "STANDARD DEVIATION ",D
:Input "SAMPLE SIZE ",N
:D/√(N)→E
:Disp "THE STANDARD ERROR IS ",E
```

#### Program Desc

This program needs the inputs of the standard deviation and sample size. After a simple calculation, it will display the answer.

#### Equation

The equation is something that can be calculated about a statistic. Here is the equation and wikipedia link:

```
       d
s ≈  -----
      √(s)
Where
s = sample/population size
d = standard deviation
```
