# Hardy Weinberg Equation

```
:Disp "HARDY WEINBERG"
:Input "V1 ",P
:(1-P)→Q
:(P²)→X
:(2*P*Q)→Y
:(Q²)→Z
:Disp "HOMOZYGOUS V1"
:Disp X
:Disp "HETEROZYGOUS"
:Disp Y
:Disp "HOMOZYGOUS V2"
:Disp Z
```

#### Program Desc

It will display the title of the program and input the only needed value (just the p not p^2 or anything) and will calculate everything from there. After, it will display the results.

#### Equation

The Hardy-Weinberg Equation theorem will describe alleleic frequencies in populations under the Hardy-Weinberg Constraints. The equation will find the percent of organisms that will have the genotype. This is useful for seeing evolution is occuring.
