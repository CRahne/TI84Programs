# Biomass

```
:Input "STARTING MASS ",M
:Input "LEVELS AWAY ",L
:((10^(L)*M)â†’A
:Disp "THE BIOMASS IS ",A
```

#### Program Description

Will ask for the varible, starting mass, and then will calculate the bio mass that many levels away using the rule of tens.

#### Equation

Biomass is pretty much how the 'mass' produced at each level of an ecosystem is moved up the system. Starting at producers, it will end at the final consumers. In the rule of tens, the producers have 100% of the mass, primary consumers 10%, secondary consumers 1%, and so on and so forth. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology))
