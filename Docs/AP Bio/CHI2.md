#### Program Desc

Will prompt the observed and total values (not marked) and will calculate the rest and display the answer. The code was written quickly but it works.

#### Equation

The chi squared test is put onto sets of data that can show external pressure acting on data. In other words, it will reveal if the data is random or not with a margin of error. You will need a chi squared table to find the result (rejected or failed to reject). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared)
