# Distance between two points on a 1D Line
```
:Disp "ONE DIMENSIONAL DISTANCE"
:Input "A VALUE? ",A
:Input "B VALUE? ",B
:abs(A-B)â†’D
:Disp "THE DISTANCE IS",D
```

#### Program Desc

Will ask for points a and b, then return the absolute value of their difference

#### Equation

The equation behind this is simple:

```
| a - b | = d

Where:
a = point 1
b = point 2
d = distance
```
