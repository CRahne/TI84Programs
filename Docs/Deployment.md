### Sending Code to the Calculator

1. Connect your calculator to the USB port on your computer with the USB cable that comes with the charger (micro USB in calculator and other end in computer)
2. Go to the `Calculator Explorer` tab. It is like a file explorer for your calculator's memory.

4. Navigate to the file location of this repository on your machine.
5. Click on what program(s) you want on your calculator.
6. Done. This is the basic knowledge you need in order to use this repository. However, you will find it helpful to learn more through forums, Texas Instruments, and other resources.

### Editing the Code

1. All of this code is written in TI-Basic. You can download a pdf from Texas Instrument [here](https://education.ti.com/-/media/377A0772C3B04D83B83D2A4E51029D08)
2. Go to the `Program Editor` tab in the TI Connect CI User Interface
