# Documentation ReadMe

The docs will be located in the same directory with the same name as the one that it is actually located. They will also have the same name as the program.

The documentation will have the raw code, an explanation of the program, and maybe an explanation of the equation that it is solving.

New code probably won't come with documentation. However, it is always a work in progress and probably will be coming soon.
