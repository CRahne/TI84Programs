# Documentation ReadMe

The documentation of this repository is set up like this: the broad docs will set out in the open. The code docs will be located in the folder of the same name as the program's package. Each one of these packages will its own ReadMe as a directory/guide that will link to all of the other program mds. The program markdowns will have the code sitting out, a desc of the program, and the desc of the equation/purpose.
