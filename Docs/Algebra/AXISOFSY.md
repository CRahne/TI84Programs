# Axis of Symmetry

```
:Disp "AXIS OF SYMMETRY"
:Prompt A
:Prompt B
:(­B/2A)→X
:Disp X
```

#### Program Description

Finds the `x` value for the axis of symmetry from the `a` and `b` variables from `y = ax^2 + bx +c`.


#### Equation

The equation is:
```
     -b
x = ----  which is derived from y = ax^2 + bx + c
     2a
```
This will give us `x` and we can know that the vertex occurs at `x`. From there, we can find the `y` variable by plugging it into the original parabola's formula.
