# TI-84 Programs Repo

Programs written by CRahne for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator. All of these were written using either the built-in calculator editor or a desktop application. All of these programs are written in TI-Basic and should work on the texas instrument family, but they are optimized for the TI-84.


A majority of these are just math equations that I found too tedious or just not fun to do (like Distance between two points). I used Texas Instrument's [Tutorial PDF](https://education.ti.com/-/media/377A0772C3B04D83B83D2A4E51029D08). It is a great resource to use for programming.


Contents of the documentation include explanations and the deployment of the code.

### Current Developments

College Algebra will be receiving the most attention as that is the math class I am in now

Testing/Documentation will also be updated, as it has fallen severly behind
- AP_BIO is up to date
- Algebra
- College Algebra is in progess
- Geometry
- Physics
- Sequences
- Stats
